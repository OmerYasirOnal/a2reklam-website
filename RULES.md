# Repo Rules

- Never commit private assets from `RES*` or full image outputs in `public/assets/img/`.
- Keep builds green: run `npm run build` before pushing when possible.
- Avoid URL changes unless matching redirects are added to `public/.htaccess` and `redirect-map.json`.
- SEO/AIO standards: unique titles/descriptions per page, preserve canonical + hreflang, no keyword stuffing.
- Commit messages: `type: short summary` (for example, `chore: update demo assets`).
