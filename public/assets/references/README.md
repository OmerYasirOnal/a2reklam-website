# References assets

Place optimized client logo assets under `public/assets/references/logos/` as `.svg` (preferred) or `.webp`.

Notes:
- Keep file sizes small (prefer 200-400px width, transparent background if possible).
- Match each filename to the reference slug you add in `src/data/references.ts`.
- If a logo is not available, leave it out and the UI will fall back to a text tile.
- See `public/assets/references/logos/README.md` for the pending logo checklist.
