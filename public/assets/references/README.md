# References Logos

Place optimized client logo assets here as `.png` or `.webp` files.

Notes:
- Keep file sizes small (prefer 200-400px width, transparent background if possible).
- Match each filename to the reference slug you add in `src/consts.ts`.
- If a logo is not available, leave it out and the UI will fall back to a text tile.
