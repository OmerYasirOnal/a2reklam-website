## Why Permits Matter for Facade Signage in Istanbul

Facade signage is highly visible and tightly regulated in Istanbul. Municipal approval and advertising tax declarations are common requirements for exterior signs. Getting the paperwork right early prevents delays and reduces rework costs.

This checklist is designed for businesses that need a clear, step-by-step overview before placing an order.

## Documentation Checklist

Prepare these items before submitting a permit request:

- Building facade measurements and drawings
- Signage layout and dimensions
- Material specification (composite, acrylic, stainless, etc.)
- Electrical plan for illuminated signage
- Installation method and mounting details

## Measurement and Visibility Planning

A sign can be compliant but still underperform. For strong visibility, align the size with traffic speed and viewing distance. In busy retail streets, concise messaging and high contrast are more effective than oversized panels.

## Materials and Durability

Material selection affects both visual impact and maintenance costs. Common options include:

- **Aluminum composite:** light and cost-effective
- **Stainless steel:** premium look, long lifespan
- **Acrylic (plexi):** modern finish and clean edges

If you plan LED lighting, confirm heat management and cable routing during design to avoid on-site revisions.

## Installation Workflow

1. On-site measurement and scope confirmation
2. Design and municipal paperwork
3. Production and quality control
4. Installation and electrical connection
5. Final inspection and handover

## Cost Drivers to Watch

- Sign area (m²) and height
- Lighting type and power infrastructure
- Mounting access (scaffold or lift)
- Material thickness and finishing
