## Totem and Facade Signs: Key Differences

When choosing signage for your business, the most important decision is whether to use a totem or facade sign. Both options have their unique advantages. This guide provides a detailed comparison to help you make the right decision.

### What is a Totem Sign?

A totem sign is a vertical advertising structure mounted on the ground, independent of the building. Typically preferred by:

- May need special equipment for maintenance

### What is a Facade Sign?

A facade sign is the classic sign type mounted on the front surface of a building:

- Stores
- Offices
- Restaurants
- Clinics
- Boutiques

**Facade Sign Advantages:**
- Location directly above business entrance
- More economical installation
- Easy maintenance and replacement
- Municipal permit usually simpler
- Harmony with building aesthetics
