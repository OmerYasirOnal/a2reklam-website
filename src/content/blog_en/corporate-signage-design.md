## Corporate Signage: The Face of Your Brand

Corporate signage creates your business's first impression in the physical world. A well-designed sign elevates your brand value; a poor sign can turn potential customers away from your door. Here are 7 golden rules to follow in corporate signage design.

### 1. Brand Consistency

Your sign must be in complete harmony with your brand identity:

- **Color palette:** Use your corporate colors exactly
- **Typography:** Choose your brand font or closest alternative
- **Logo:** Vector, high-resolution logo file is essential
- **Message:** Use slogan consistently if you have one

> **Mistake:** The most common error is incorrect conversion of print colors (CMYK) to sign colors (RAL/Pantone). Always get physical sample approval for color matching.

### 2. Readability and Visibility

**Distance Readability Rule:**
- 1 cm letter height for every 10 meters distance
- Sign to be read from 50 meters: minimum 5 cm letters
- To be read from vehicle on main road: minimum 15-20 cm letters

| Distance | Minimum Letter Height | Recommended |
|----------|----------------------|-------------|
| 10m | 2.5 cm | 5 cm |
| 25m | 6 cm | 10 cm |
| 50m | 12 cm | 20 cm |
| 100m | 25 cm | 40 cm |

### 3. Material Selection

**Stainless Steel Letters:**
- Premium appearance
- 20+ year lifespan
- Minimum maintenance
- High initial cost

**Plexiglass/Acrylic:**
- Suitable for backlighting
- Colored or transparent options
- Care needed against impacts

**Aluminum Composite:**
- Light and durable
- Economical
- Wide color range

### 4. Lighting Strategy

The right lighting doubles your sign's impact:

- **Frontlit:** Front spotlight, classic look
- **Backlit:** Backlighting, halo effect
- **Edge-lit:** Edge lighting, modern and elegant
- **Combined:** Both front and back, maximum impact

### 5. Location and Placement

Sign placement is as important as design:

- **Eye level:** Ideal for pedestrian traffic
- **Building top:** For vehicle traffic and long-distance visibility
- **Above entrance:** Standard for store/office entrances
- **Corner position:** Addresses two streets at once

### 6. Municipal Regulations

Each district may have different signage regulations:

- Maximum size limitations
- Lighting restrictions (especially in residential areas)
- Color and material standards
- Permit processes

### 7. Maintenance and Durability

For a long-lasting sign:

- **Annual cleaning:** Prevent dust and dirt buildup
- **Electrical inspection:** Annual LED and cable check
- **Weather conditions:** Prefer stainless for Istanbul's humid climate
