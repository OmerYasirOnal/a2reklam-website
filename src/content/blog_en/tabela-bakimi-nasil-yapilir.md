## Why is Signage Maintenance and Cleaning Important?
Outdoor advertising products are directly exposed to Istanbul's challenging weather conditions (humidity, sun, snow, and wind). Signs that are not regularly maintained fade over time, lighting systems fail, and your brand's prestige is damaged.

### Things to Consider in Signage Cleaning
1. **Use of Soft Cloth:** Avoid stiff brushes that can scratch plexiglass or stainless steel surfaces.
2. **Chemical Selection:** Instead of very abrasive chemicals, use mild soapy water or special cleaners suitable for the surface.
3. **LED and Electrical Control:** Have the electrical connections checked by an expert team at least once a year.
