## Why Stainless Letter Signs Are a Premium Choice

Stainless letter signs (also known as metal channel letters) offer a clean, modern look and long-term durability. They are popular for corporate headquarters, premium retail, and hotel entrances in Istanbul because they deliver both prestige and readability.

## Finish Options: Brushed vs. Polished

- **Brushed stainless:** diffuses reflections and looks refined in daylight
- **Polished stainless:** more eye-catching, best for low-glare facades

Your facade orientation and ambient light should guide the choice.

## Lighting Types

- **Front-lit:** highest visibility at night
- **Back-lit (halo):** softer glow and premium look
- **Combination:** maximum impact with layered lighting

## Installation Workflow

1. Site survey and facade measurement
2. Design and 3D preview
3. CNC cutting and assembly
4. Lighting integration and wiring
5. On-site installation and testing

## Pricing Drivers

- Letter height and thickness
- Steel grade and finish
- Lighting system and power access
- Installation height and access
